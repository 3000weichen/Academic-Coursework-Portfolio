Team Members:
- Cañas Jiménez, Diego
- Chen, Hao
- Im, Adrien
- Komeili Zadeh, Koorosh
- Peng, Yihui

Goal: Model human memory retrieval under uncertainty.

Key work:
- Constructed memory activation and recognition simulation
- Generated *receiver operating characteristic (ROC)* to measure discrimination
- Analyzed false alarm vs. hit rates under noise changes

Outcome:
Understanding how activation strength influences recognition sensitivity.
